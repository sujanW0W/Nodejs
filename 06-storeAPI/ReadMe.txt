In this project, I learnt about different functionaities that MongoDB and Mongoose(npm) provide.

I learnt to search, sort, pagination, and so forth.

Search on the basis of exact name, some characters that exist in the name using Regular Expression.

Sort in ascending and descending order, numeric filter - items having numeric value of some sort(greater, less, equal) using Regular Expression.

Pagination - Limit items per page, Skip number of items based on page number.

Filter the data to be sent - providing only requested fields of the document.
